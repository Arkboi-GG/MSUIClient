// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// SKETCH OBJECT MODEL — shared_docs/SPELL_SKETCH.md §2 (fields) and §9 (defaults).
//
// A Sketch is what the owner draws: pieces (painted planes on sticks), how each
// one moves, and what hangs off it. It compiles to ONE vanilla M2 (v256) plus a
// BLP per piece (SketchTextures + SketchWriter), after which it is an ordinary
// phase model and every existing IDE dial applies.
//
// Every field here is a number a human can say out loud. No field is a file
// offset: the whole point of the subsystem seam is that the WINDOW edits this,
// and only SketchWriter knows what a byte is.
//
// LAW (CODE_STRUCTURE_LAW §1): this namespace never references GameLoop.
//
// Units are YARDS and SECONDS throughout, in the CASTER frame:
//   Forward = +X, Left = +Y, Up = +Z   (the raw M2 file frame; the runtime
//   reader swaps to model space itself — SPELL_SKETCH.md §4.2, and see
//   SketchWriter for the one place that conversion is allowed to matter).
