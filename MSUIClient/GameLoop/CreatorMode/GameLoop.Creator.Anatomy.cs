// SPELL ANATOMY — the top of the Sketch window (owner, 2026-09-10):
//
//   "the tool must become an IDE that I can start from 0, decide if i want
//    precast or no, then cast, then missile if thats part of it, if not
//    impact, or channel if that's the cast - etc. The IDE user gets to decide
//    that, and has a tool that lets them understand/create every piece of the
//    puzzle."
//
// A spell's visual is not one thing, it is a handful of independent slots on a
// SpellVisual row, and the game fires every slot that is populated
// (SpellVisualCatalog.cs:44-45: "every populated slot on a reached row fires.
// The stage selects LIFETIME POLICY only"). So the anatomy IS the set of slots
// you choose to fill, and that choice is the first thing an author makes.
//
// WHY A PLAN, AND NOT JUST "DOES IT HAVE ART". Because in the data, a precast
// you deliberately left out and a precast you have not got to yet look exactly
// the same: empty. One is finished and one is a to-do, and only the author
// knows which. So the plan is stored, and the list below shows three states
// rather than two - planned and authored, planned and empty (a to-do), and not
// part of this spell.
//
// Each row also says WHEN it plays and HOW LONG it lives, because that is the
// part nobody can read off the data.
